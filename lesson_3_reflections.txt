When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    It provides an additional back-up point as well as making a repository for 
	collaborators to contribute to.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Allows you to wait to share changes with collaborators until the changes are ready 

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Branches track versions in a single repository, clones duplicate an entire
	repository, forks duplicate an entire repository on GitHub.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It allows you to work offline and be able to integrate/keep up to date with 
	the remote version.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    Collaborate by sending files back and forth. GitHub is easier because of VC. 

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?

    Make a new branch if you are collaborating with others, so the master is not changed
	out from under other people. working directly on master makes sense when you work alone
	or aren't making significant base changes.
